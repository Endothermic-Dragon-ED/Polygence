Please note that these Jupyter Notebook labs have been slightly modified. This is due to how the markdown is parsed in each platform. The differences between the actual lab in Google Colab and this version on GitHub are listed below:

- Linear Regression - "_" in markdown LaTeX's `\text{...}` in Google Colab has been replaced with "\_" in markdown LaTeX's `\text{...}` in this respository
- Neural Networks - "#" in markdown LaTeX's `\text{...}` in Google Colab has been replaced with "\#" in markdown LaTeX's `\text{...}` in this respository
